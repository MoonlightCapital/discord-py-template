# Discord.Py Template

A template written in Python to develop a Discord bot. This code has been re-arranged from https://github.com/SourSpoon/Discord.py-Template, and partially rewritten in a developer friendly way. Featuring:

- Easy to add commands: you can extend pre-existing cogs or make new ones. Just put them in the `/cogs` folder to have them automatically loaded into the code.
- [jishaku](https://pypi.org/project/jishaku/) is included. It gives developers tools to speed up debugging and testing.
- Support for a MongoDB database using the [umongo](https://umongo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) library, to save data persistently in a non-blocking way.
- Reaction confirm helper functions and error handling made easy.
- Support for env variables
- Repl.it support (with keepalive)
- Docker support
- Gateway intents are up to date so you'll have no problem spinning this up in 2020

So feel free to fork it and create your own bot!
